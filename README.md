# Sudoku validator

A console application that takes a **9x9 sudoku grid** (entirely completed or not), and returns if the grid is **valid or not**.

The possible errors are :
- Same number in the same line ;
- Same number in the same column ;
- Same number in the same 3x3 subbox.

The program returns which error occured, but not in which position for the moment.
